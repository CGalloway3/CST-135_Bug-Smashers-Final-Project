Project timelime:

  Weel 1: 
    Develop story board, dispenser UML, and product UML
  Week 2:
    Expand on product UML by making it abstract and creating subclasses of drink, snack, candy, chips, and gum.
  Week 3: Updated 04-09-18
    Made classes drink and snack implement the compartable interface. Added some rudiment form of a user interface
  week 4: further work on the user interface adding transaction processing.

    
  Our current approach in design is to have a dispenser class with slot loctaions in it and products defined by the product class 
in those slot locations. When the user purchases a product the code will trigger a dispensing mechanism for the items slot dropping
the item to the user.
  
Instructions:
  This is the full package of working netbeans project code. Run the main class, just have them all in the same folder and they should package themselves.
