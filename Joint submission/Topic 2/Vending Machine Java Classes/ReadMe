Project timelime:

  Weel 1: 
    Develop story board, dispenser UML, and product UML
  Week 2:
    Expand on product UML by making it abstract and creating subclasses of drink, snack, candy, chips, and gum.
    
  Our current approach in design is to have a dispenser class with slot loctaions in it and products defined by the product class 
in those slot locations. When the user purchases a product the code will trigger a dispensing mechanism for the items slot dropping
the item to the user.
  
  This is the full package of working code. Run the main class, just have them all in the same folder and they should package themselves.
I only created 3 of each type of product, but the code is dynamic so you can add more, just follow the same format.
