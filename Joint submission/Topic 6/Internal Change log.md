Commenting and code clean up is still needed and on  			going. Next i will begin working on file read and write for inventory.

04-24-18 23:43 CST (Chad) I DID IT!!!!!  Animations are sorted, maybe a little tweeking of speed and size reduction are in order for later but as of now the animations 					are better looking than I could have expected. I added a few new classes, one for the animations and one for transactions. Also, created a files folder 				for all the csv files we are going to need this week.
