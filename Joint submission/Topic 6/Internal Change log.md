CST-135 Topic 6 Change log

04-24-18 23:43 CST (Chad) I DID IT!!!!!  Animations are sorted, maybe a little tweeking of speed and size reduction are in order for later but as of now the animations 			are better looking than I could have expected. I added a few new classes, one for the animations and one for transactions. Also, created a files folder 			for all the csv files we are going to need this week.

04-27-18 17:26 CST (Chad) Moved current project to Topic 6 folder, created a folder 'Shared inventory file' to share our product list file with the other team, created change 					log and removed all images in the snack folder as snack is an abstract class.
