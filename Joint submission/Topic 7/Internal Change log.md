			  it sure does look pretty.

05-03-18 22:11 CST (Chad) Touched almost every file doing clean up passes on comments, spelling, and minor bug fixing. Added CustomerDisplay class as per actitivty directions					  Part 2: (class is blank with zero functionallity). Added required methods (first(), lenght(), in(), out(), and isEmpty()) to ProcessCustomerQueue as
			  per Part 1: #2 b of directions. Also added code to get customer queue from text file as per Part 1 #2 a of directions. The file "Customer Queue.csv",
			  however is still blank. Changed ArrayList in ProcessCustomerQueue to a LinkedList for better compatibility with queue operations.
