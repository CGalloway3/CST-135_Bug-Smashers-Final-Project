First off, apologies. Fell asleep without uploading.
Second, the following are all the changes I've made to the build.

Added functionality to "Coin Return"
Declared ArrayList cart
changed price type from double to int
Added function to item buttons that:
	adds selected item price to products cost
	adds selected item to cart
Changed item button labels so they all call p.toString
	*this was why some displayed price and some didn't 
Changed price data in populateProductList() to: 
	reflect new int type for price 
	add realistic variation in price 
Changed toString methods in all classes to adjust for new int type price and to display well on buttons 
added pop up windows for both "my items" and "complete purchase"
	*neither have the ability to remove items, couldn't figure it out
	*"complete purchase" still needs to have total cost added to bottom
