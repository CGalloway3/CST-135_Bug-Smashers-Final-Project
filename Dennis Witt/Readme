Project timelime:

  Week 1: 
    Develop story board, dispenser UML, and product UML
  Week 2:
    Expand on product UML by making it abstract and creating subclasses of drink, snack, candy, chips, and gum.
  Week 3: 
    Update Snack and Drink classes so they implement the comparable interface.
    Update the snack and drink classes with a compareTo() method the items they need to implement the comparable interface in alphabetical order by name then by their price in the compareTo() method.  Items with the same name should be ordered on price in ascending order.  If two items have the same name and price, they are considered equal.  Write a main method that tests your compareTo() method.
Example:
if ((this.Pepsi).equals(other.Tea)) {
return - 0;
return = 0;
int compare = a.compareTo(b);

if (compare < 0) {
    //a is smaller
}
else if (compare > 0) {
    //a is larger
}
else {
    //a is equal to b
}
